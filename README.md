# Purpose of this Repository
I made this repository as a place to show off my work from various academic/personal projects.

# Introduction
Hello My name is Michael Colcough, and I am recently Graduated from University of Maryland, Batimore County. I received a **BS in Computer Science** with a focus in **Game Design and 
Cybersecurity**. I have a thriving passion for *designing and devoloping games* ever since I first I played my first game as a young boy. I am striving to see my name in the credits of
my own game someday.
